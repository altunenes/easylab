From a folder, it can resize images, change their extensions, applies spatial frequencies, and remove backgrounds... Purpose of the project The purpose of the project is to offer a simple solution to solve some of the problems that arise when working with big image datasets. The project is a work in progress, and it is not finished yet. Since it offers GUI, it is very practical to use it. Features Resize images Change extension Apply spatial frequencies Apply Gaussian blur Apply gray scale filter Rename images Remove background from images installation Install easylab with pip: pip install easylab Usage it is very simple to use the project. For the open GUI, use the following command: from EasyLab import EasyLab then open the gui with: EasyLab.easylab() It's easy, just select the folder where your images are stored and select extension and size. \"Rename\" button will change all images' names like this: \"0image\", \"1image\",\"2image\"... and so on... I use this command to standardize the picture names while doing deep learning. Read before the usage! For unforeseen consequences be sure to copy the original images elsewhere. Javascript I will also add some javascript to online version. E-prime scripts get the trail list (Image names for the E-Prime) or create a jitter: https://altunenes.github.io/EasyLab/filenames Contributing Contributions are welcome!

You can adjust RMS, cutoff frequency, and order of the filter. Warning : Matplotlib doesn't work with pixels directly, but rather physical sizes and DPI. If you want to display a figure with certain pixel size, you need to know the DPI of your monitor.

Just open the gui with: first import the easylab module: from easylab import easylab then open the gui with following command: easyLab.easylabgui() I also provide a online demo for the getting image names from the folder with Javascript. You can find it here: https://altunenes.github.io/easylab/filenames It also contains a jitter list generator for further processing. It is useful for some experiments to avoid problems with the constant durations. Other Scripts Easylab will be updated as solutions come to the problems encountered in the laboratory. These problems are mostly related to stimulant preparation and E-Prime. So some solutions probably only basic scripts and they will not add to the GUI. List of other Scripts: Filelistfromfolder.py : Generates a list of filenames from a folder. You can find the information on the script. By the way, online demo that written in javascript do same thing. e_prime_bullshit.py : A strange problem with E-Prime. Sometimes, e-prime doesn't read the images ( We still don't know why). This basic script will fix the whole process. requirements Python 3.6 or higher Tkinter (for GUI) psychopy (for the butterworth filter) opencv (for the filters, image processing) numpy (for the mathematical operations) matplotlib (for the image visualization) rembg (for the background removal)","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"userguide/#installation","text":"Install easylab with pip: pip install easylab","title":"installation"},{"location":"userguide/#usage","text":"easylab provides a GUI, so you don't need to write any code.
